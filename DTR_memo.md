### DTR Memo

Project: Enigma 

Group Member Names: Bao Nguyen and Ben Jacobs

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project? 

Ben - Wants to solve all aspects of the problem. Improve test driven development skills and work effectively as a team.

Bao - Wants to whiteboard solution ahead of time and map it all out before we start coding in order to do the heavy lifting up front and then implement a plan.

Goals and expectations:

Better implementing TDD with full test coverage on individual methods, integration and edge-cases
Good code structure
Full functionality with all character and interaction extensions
Figure out what a calculated approach to decryption means
Share work load and benefit from each others areas of strength 
Overcome the obstacle of both of us having previously generally worked alone
	
Team strengths:

Relatively solid knowledge of ruby functionality and structure.
Good grasp of basic computer science concepts.
Both team members have minimal outside commitments.

How to overcome obstacles:

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):

Generally going to work together early before class, immediately after class but before 5pm and lunches if neccessary. All other free time will be for individual work

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):

We'll have daily check-ins and set next communication time based on project status. Keep lines open on slack at any time if either of us is road-blocked. We'll assume to spend more group time toward the beginning and end of project, but do certain tasks individually to maximize time efficiency

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Both of us are confident in each others technical ability. We have similar desire for improvement in testing. We want to remain open to alternate coding ideas and refactoring suggestions.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

Neither of us have a strong opening opinion about specific features we'd like to work on, but will remain open to any desires that might arise. We plan to split up classes and methods at first based on a road map we create together and then implement at a later stage.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests): 

Keep master clean of any non-functioning code. Review code locally and push up to working branch as we go. Try to utilize pull requests, but do as much local review as possible until we are comfortable with git flow.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Communicate about code readability. Stay open to new ideas. Be kind and constructive with all feedback. Expect that both members will actively give feedback to make the best possible project.

Agenda to discuss project launch:

n/a

Ideas:

Will update after whiteboard exercise
Try to use modules for common methods between classes

Tools:

VS code, pry, github, slack
